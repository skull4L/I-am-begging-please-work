Creating an ecosphere is a relatively simple process, all you really require is a [[Content/Containers|suitable container]] and a [[Water bodies|water body.]]

## Plants
[[Content/Plants/Plants overview|Plants]] can be found in most water body, but can alternatively be bought instead, I tend to usually do this as it allows me to use plants that I know work well. However, most native plants will thrive in an ecosphere.

## Animals
[[Content/Animals/Animals overview|Animals]] can be found as simply as scooping [[Sediment|sediment]] from the bottom of whatever water body you choose to use, for more information on collection techniques please see [[Sourcing organisms|sourcing organisms.]] 

## Simple creation steps
I prefer to use a jar, but most types of container will do, please see [[Content/Containers|containers]] for more info.
 
The first step is to add the sediment to your container, you can assemble your ecosphere in the field or at home, I personally prefer home assemblage as it tends to be less hassle. If going this route, fill 2 separate containers of sediment and water. Try to only take as much sediment as you need, excess sediment should be returned as it is full of animal life. To avoid this issue, you could fill your jar with sediment in the field and add water at home.
You should only add roughly 4cm (1.5â€³) of sediment, use a little less for smaller jars and a little more for larger jars, it really depends on the shape of the jar, but you can usually tell by eye when it's at a good level, **do be careful however to not use too much, that is a mistake that many beginners make!**

The next step is to add your plants, most stem plants can be pushed into the wet sediment with tweezers, I would however recommend adding floating plants after adding the water. If using stem plant be sure to push them down to the bottom of the sediment as trying to push them back into the ground once submerged is a nightmare!

The final step is to add the water, be careful not to add it too quickly as it will cause the sediment to cloud up the container. I recommend slowly pouring the water down the side of the container or slowly siphoning in the water to avoid this issue. Fill the container almost to the top, leaving an air gap to allow for gas exchange. There is no set size for this air gap because every jar is different in shape, however for most containers you can usually make it a little over the length of your thumbprint.

## Simple care
For the first few days after creation, I would recommend leaving the lid open, conditions within the ecosphere will be at their most chaotic. The water may be murky, which may limit photosynthesis which could lead to mass die offs which would severely limit the biodiversity of your ecosphere. Keep it in a decently lit window away from direct sunshine, you could also use LED lights which is useful to keep lighting consistent all year round. Please see [[Content/Lighting|lighting]] for more information. Always keep your ecosphere at room temperature, overheating can cause it to collapse. **As a general rule of thumb, the glass should be cool to the touch.**
