Plants are essential aspect of any ecosphere, without them life in a sealed ecosystem would not be possible. They oxygenate the water and filter out chemicals such as ammonia, nitrites and nitrates which occur due to the decomposition of organic matter. They also provide food for nearly all the organisms inside and represent the starting point of any food web as they produce their own energy via photosynthesis which can be passed along trophic levels. 

Most aquatic plants can be used with varying degrees of success, however here you will find a selection of plants that have been specifically tested for their viability for the use in aquatic ecospheres.
Here is the information you will see on each plant profile:
> - Scientific name - The universal Latin name
> - Growth rate - How fast this plant can push out new growth
> - Lighting - How much light this plant needs to do well
> - Edibility - How easy it is for organisms to consume this plant

Additional notes will be also mentioned.
