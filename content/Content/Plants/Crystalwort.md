### Notes:
Extremely unique looking plant, tends to float but can be tied to sticks or rocks to prevent this. This plant is a personal favourite of mine and I consider it to be among the best plants for aquatic ecospheres. Its surface growth allows it to access atmospheric CO2 which gives it an advantage against other plants.
